# Radar-using-Arduino
In this project, I developed a radar system using an ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor, and an LCD display to detect and visualize the distance of objects. 
The ultrasonic sensor was mounted on the servo motor, which rotated to scan the surrounding area. 
The sensor measured the distance to objects and sent the data to the Arduino, which controlled the servoâ€™s movement and processed the distance readings. 
The LCD display was used to show the distance measurements in real-time, providing a visual representation of the detected objects.
My responsibilities included designing the hardware setup, programming the Arduino to control the servo and process sensor data, and integrating the LCD display for real-time feedback. 
# Hardware connections
Servo Motor: pin D5.<br>  
Ultrasonic Sensor: trig pin D2 / echo pin D3.
LCD I2C : SDA pin A4 / SCL pin A5.
